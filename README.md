❄️ Snowman Rescue ❄️ — A Winter Word-Guessing Game

A cozy winter-themed browser game built for GA SEB Unit 1

🎮 Game Description

Snowman Rescue is a winter-themed word-guessing game inspired by classic “Hangman”—but with a cozy twist.
Your goal is to guess the hidden winter word before the snowman melts completely!
Each wrong guess melts the snowman a little more.
Guess all the letters correctly, and confetti falls as you save him!
This game was created as my Unit 1 Project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. I chose this game because:
I love winter themes and cozy seasonal aesthetics ❄️
It’s a beginner-friendly challenge that uses arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, loops, and events
I wanted to practice building an interactive UI with visual feedback
